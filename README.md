# license_plate_detector
Learned to create a custom object detector using YOLOv4. This was possible because of The AI Guy's wonderful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmj3nxGT2YQ.<br>
The .ipynb file is better suited to run in a Google Colab environment. Also I have customized the file a little bit than the one shown in the video.<br>
Also for now the backups generated and the test and train images are in my drive which are a lot in terms of size. Just watch the video I mentioned above to make one for yourself.
